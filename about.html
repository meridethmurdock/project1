        <p> “This is dedicated to all of my precious grandchildren. Whitney, Merideth, Bella, Riley, Maddie, Allie, & Jackson. 
        These are some of my favorite recipes that I have cooked for all of you over the years. 
        I hope that when you look at this book or cook some of the recipes you remember how much 
        Meme loves you and how much I enjoyed making all of these things for you. I love you all so much!</p>

        <p>Proverbs 3:5&6 <br>
        <em>Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and do not rely on your own understanding; 
        in all your ways know Him, and He will make your paths straight.</em></p>

        <p>These verses have gotten me through some very tough times. It may not have turned out like I wanted it to, 
        but God had a plan better than mine. He has a plan for all of you. Just trust Him to guide you and always 
        pray about things before you jump head first into them. My prayer is that we will all be in heaven together one day!</p>

        <p>Last year, my grandma gave all of her grandchildren a recipe book filled with the recipes to some of the best food I've ever tasted. 
        It was such an amazing and thoughtful surprise, so I wanted to surprise her this Christmas with her very own website!</p>
